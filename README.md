These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

Use git clone in console to clone repository to your current location:

```
git -clone https://github.com/wojciechKomorowski/Recruitment-Task-Primesoft.git
```

### Installing

Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) environment.

```
npm install
```

All packages from package.json devDependencies should be installed in node_modules.

```

    "babel-core": "^6.26.0",
    "babel-loader": "^7.1.2",
    "babel-preset-es2015": "^6.24.1",

    "style-loader": "^0.19.1",
    "webpack": "^3.6.0",
    "webpack-dev-server": "^2.9.4"

```

To use modules you need to run webpack through console in your project location:

```
node_modules/.bin/webpack
```

If you installed webpack globally, you can type:

```
webpack
```

Open new tab in console to run webpack-dev-server:
